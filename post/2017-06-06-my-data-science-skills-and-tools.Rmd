Here is a selection of my Data Science skills and tools that turned out to be helpful in my work and I believe are important for any Data Scientist as well.

The last update of this post was done: `r Sys.Date()`.

1. __Data Manipulation__   
    * Fast data manipulation with R packages:   
    `dplyr`, `data.table`, `reshape2`. 
    * Working with dates and time-series:   
    `lubridate`, `xts`.
