      <description>Editor settingSet 80 characters as the maximum length of the line in R Studio, and obey that limit.Set 2 spaces for code indendation.Naming conventionBe consistent.Use lowercase verb with underscores _ for variable name: add_numbers().You can group related functions from the same package using prefixes: math_add_numbers().You can use CamelCase or camelCase naming convention if you inisist, but please, do not use periods inside function and variable names.</description>

      <description>This post is an annotated bibliography of helpful resources for programming and doing Data Science in R. I will try to expand this list and add some short recommendations in the future.

Books (on-line &amp;amp; printed)Hadley Wickham, Advanced R
The book is designed primarily for R users who want to improve their programming skills and understanding of the language. It should also be useful for programmers coming to R from other languages, as it explains some of R’s quirks and shows how some parts that seem horrible do have a positive side.</description>

      <description>Version: 1.2The last update of this post: 2018-05-06.
Below is a checklist that I wrote for my own purposes. I helps me to be sure that I did what I should have done before release a new version of R package to CRAN. Maybe it will also help others.
See what new Hadley recommends:
(http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/release.html).Update R &amp;amp; packages:Rall packagesRStudio (stable or preview version).Update your package:Check unit tests.</description>
