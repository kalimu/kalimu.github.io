      <description>Logging Events in Shiny AppsR package shinyEventLogger is a logging framework dedicated for complex shiny apps. Different types of events can be logged (character string, value of a variable, multi-line output of a function, result of a unit test, custom error, warning, or diagnostic message). Each event can be logged with a list of parameters that are event-specific, common for a group of events, or common for all app events.</description>
