      <description>UPDATE: The online static version of the presentation is available here: http://rpubs.com/kalimu/erum. Thank you for all the feedback!
In two days, from 12 to 14 October, 2016 in Poznan (Poland) will take place the conference “eRum 2016: european R users meeting“. I will give a talk about new R package: LimeRick. LimeRick enables close connection between two important open-source projects: R and LimeSurvey. LimeSurvey is the most advanced open-source system for on-line survey and Computer Aided Web Interviewing (CAWI) and together with R they offer advanced ecosystem for gathering and analyzing declarative data.</description>

      <description>limeRick: The bridge between LimeSurvey and RThe R package LimeRick enables close connection between R and LimeSurvey - one of the most popular and advanced open-source scripts for on-line surveys (a.k.a. CAWI - Computer-Aided Web Interviewing). Using new LimeSurvey RemoteControl2 API for two-way data exchange the package allows for:
importing on-line survey responses into R,adding new responses to the survey directly from R,automatically accessing surveys and question properties,implementing passive measurement surveys,developing data products based on real-time declarative data collection.</description>

      <description>Version: 1.2The last update of this post: 2018-05-06.
Below is a checklist that I wrote for my own purposes. I helps me to be sure that I did what I should have done before release a new version of R package to CRAN. Maybe it will also help others.
See what new Hadley recommends:
(http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/release.html).Update R &amp;amp; packages:Rall packagesRStudio (stable or preview version).Update your package:Check unit tests.</description>

      <description>R package for gender prediction based on first namesThe package uses genderize.io API to predict gender from first names extracted from text vector. The accuracy of prediction could be control by two parameters: counts of a first name in the database and probability of prediction.
